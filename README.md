# Trello Full Descriptions

This is a Chrome extension which automatically expands Trello card descriptions
when you view card details.  Without this, Trello normally truncates long card
descriptions and requires pressing a button labelled "Show full description" to
see the hidden part.  This extension overcomes that UX hurdle.

## Installation

This extension is not in the Chrome web store yet.  Until then:

1. Clone this repo anywhere you like.
1. In Chrome/Chromium, go to `chrome://extensions/`.
1. Turn on "Developer mode" (checkbox).
1. Click "Load unpacked extension...".
1. Select the directory where you cloned the repo.
1. Refresh Trello.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, there is nothing the user needs to do to use
it.  It does its job automatically whenever Trello cards are opened.
